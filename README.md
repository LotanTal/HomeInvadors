# HomeInvadors
Home Invasion is a top-down turn-based tiled map game.
Play as a hungry raccoon that breaks into a house with the goal of stealing all of the food without getting caught by the housr cat!

This project is a work in progress and was made as a showcase of implamenting:
- A* Pathfinding Algorithem (with walls avoidance)
- Tile map generation while considering obsticles, walls, doors etc. Highlighted Tiles based on parameters such as player position, player's "action points" etc.
- Opacity shader (to keep the player visable during all parts) 
- a Dynamic event & dialoge tool (still in development), that controlls specific cameras, sentances and animations based on Scriptable Objects and game states (hasItem, AlreadyTalkedToNPC, etc.)
